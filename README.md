# Dynamic-Quotation-Server
This PHP-based webpage serves as a dynamic quotation server. It randomly displays a diverse array of inspirational quotes to visitors. Additionally, it features an interactive component allowing users to contribute new quotes. The site includes a database integration for storing and retrieving these quotations efficiently. I created this as a sample assignment while working as a programming assignment help tutor for https://www.programminghomeworkhelp.com/
